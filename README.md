# Webathon-20 Website
## Inspiration
The inspiration behind this project was to create <b>a one stop service that provides CORRECT and Regularly Updated information</b> about COVID-19. <br>
There are a lot of sources and news articles out there but they just seem to add onto the confusion and that creates a situation of panic and overwhelm. The main idea of this project is to eliminate myths and guide people through this stressful time

## What it does
The website can be used to:-
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Get information about Coronavirus</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>What is Covid-19</li>
      <li>Symptoms</li>
      <li>How it is transmitted</li>
      <li>Precautions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h4>Map Explorer</h4>
    <p>Use the map explorer to explore the trends in Covid-19 in various regions</p>
  </li>
  
  
  <li>
    <h4>Assess Yourself</h4>
    <p>Take the assessment on our website to know if you should consult a doctor or not</p>
  </li>
  
  
  <li>
    <h4>Helpline Tools</h4>
    <p>Search for state and union territory helpline numbers in India on our Helpline page</p>
  </li>
  
## How I built it
We built it using NodeJS for the Backend and technologies like EJS and JQuery for the front end. We followed the MVC architecture. We divided it into pages Initially and then built them independently and created some reusable components too that were common for all the pages like the footer. The data shown is being fetched through several APIs that are updates regularly.

## Challenges I ran into
The biggest challenge for us was to create the map-tool because we had no idea how to index the countries from hovering over the map initially but then we researched about it and found a way to implement it. Other than that we also had to think about a lot of different cases while creating the assessment tool so that was also a challenge.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are really proud of the way it has turned out and also about the different tools that we have managed to build. We are the most proud of our Map explorer.

## What I learned
We learned a lot about SVGs and how beneficial they are for web developers and I also learned a lot more about JQuery and GitHub as this was a team project.

## What's next for CORshield
We want to include more features into CORshield like an interactive chatbot, more useful resources to cope up with the stress and anxiety at this time, travel updates in various locations to ease travelling.
